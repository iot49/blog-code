search works but does not find blogs for which the user is not authenticated. That's a mixed bag: good for security, but difficult for a user to get access to protected content.

What's the right solution? Add an explicit login button (changes to logout when user is logged in). Once the user is logged in, search shows all posts (or all posts the user is authorized for).

What's the right strategy?
